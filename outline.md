# 626FinalProject
* Many industries took a hit during the covid-19 pandemic. One industry that especially took a large hit was the film industry. Production all over the country was delayed as it requires large film crews to make a film work. One of the most popular places in the world to film is NYC. For my project I would like to look at open NYC data set for 'Film Permits' and compare that dataset with the 'Covid 19 Daily Count of Cases, Hospitalization, and Deaths' dataset and see if there is a connection between what I presume is to be less film permits while the number of Covid cases rise. This is obviosuly a very rough outline for what I intend to do with my final project, but I would like to hear your input to see if this is a reasonable project idea. I have an idea what story the data might tell, but like you said a lot of this class deals with the preprocessing and cleaning of data and I think these datasets could offer that.
